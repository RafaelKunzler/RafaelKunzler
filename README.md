### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Rafael**](https://my-portfolio-opal-seven-68.vercel.app), a web developer based in Brazil. I like building clean, modern interfaces, improving my problem-solving skills and turning ideas into functional projects.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- React, JavaScript, and modern front-end fundamentals
- Astro and building fast, content-focused websites
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish

---

**Some stuff I built:**
- [My Portfolio](https://github.com/RafaelKunzler/My-Portfolio) - My personal portfolio built with Astro, featuring a connected database for a message board where visitors can leave notes. 
- [Fit Flavors](https://github.com/RafaelKunzler/Fit-Flavors) - A recipe creation and storage website where you can organize your favorite meals. 
- [Resume Builder](https://github.com/RafaelKunzler/Resume-Builder) - A form-based website that generates a clean PDF resume automatically. Fill it out, click a button, and boom you’re job-ready.
- [Weather App](https://github.com/RafaelKunzler/Weather-App-2) - A weather forecast app that consumes an external API and shows today’s and weekly forecasts.
- [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/RafaelKunzler/TheOdinProject/tree/main/3.Rock%20Paper%20Scissors) - My very first project: a classic rock-paper-scissors game built with pure logic and enthusiasm. Simple, fun, and the beginning of everything.
